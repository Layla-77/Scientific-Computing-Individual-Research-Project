# Project Name: Photometric Analysis of Astronomical Images by the Wavelet Transform
This program is developed based on the Windows operating system.   
  
how the code needs to be compiled or run,   
     
The code structure of this project is as follows:    
PyDS9 and PyDS9plugin exist separately as additional referenced modules that support SAOImageDS9.  
MATLAB files are used to store wavelet analysis algorithms.  
Python code files involve interacting with the database, image processing, calling wavelet analysis algorithms and user interaction.
